Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I still feel like Encapsulaition is not super solid yet. Although I understand how it can be helpful for connecting your code and saving time I still do not fully understnad how it works. I think that as I continue to work through the homework though it will become more clear. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I ended up getting stuck on this assingnment because I could not get one part to work and so I just focused on that one part rather than keeping going and then later getting help on that one specific part. This put me behind on the assignement which then led to a pile up of work. I therefore would advise that if you get stuck on a part of an assignment in this class, if possible, keep going and then loop back to eitehr get help or see if you answered your own question by continuing to code.
